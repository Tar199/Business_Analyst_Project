# Capstone Project 

I'm excited to share the results of my MSBA capstone project:
"Market Trend Analysis of Best-Selling Steam Games Using Predictive Analytics"

📊 Objective:
To uncover key market trends, evaluate genre and developer performance, and build predictive models to estimate game downloads using real-world data from Steam.

🔍 What I Did:
✅ Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on 1800+ games
✅ Engineered features like revenue and simplified genre tagging
✅ Built & compared Machine Learning models (SVR, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost)
✅ Simulated pricing impact using what-if analysis
✅ Created an interactive Power BI dashboard for stakeholder insights
✅ Visualized feature importance and genre trends over time
✅ Evaluated models with MAE & RMSE, with SVR showing best performance
✅ Addressed ethical considerations: bias, fairness, and explainability

🧠 Tools Used: Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost), Power BI, Excel

💡 Key Insights:
🎯 High-rated, long-duration, and lower-priced games perform best
📈 Action, Open World, and Simulation genres dominate revenue
🏆 Top developers like Valve significantly outperform others

📌 Takeaway:
Combining data science with domain knowledge can reveal powerful patterns and drive smarter decisions in the gaming industry.
